## 2026-07-13 - Skylight Bridge 1.0 release

**What changed**: Completed the native macOS 26 and 27 application with selective Apple Photos, Reminders, Recipes, and Meals configuration; Liquid Glass layouts; Keychain-backed authentication; signed local state; discovered Skylight API diagnostics; and Developer ID release packaging.

**Decisions made**: Apple remains the source of truth. Photos mirror only selected albums, Favorites, or hand-picked assets. Reminders sync only selected lists or items to Skylight lists. The app intentionally provides no calendar, task, chore, or rewards synchronization interface.

**Verification**: All 39 tests passed normally, under AddressSanitizer, under ThreadSanitizer, and with the authenticated live API lifecycle enabled. The Skylight portal showed exactly two items in Money and two photos from Our House; a repeated live sync applied zero changes. Apple accepted and stapled the signed app and DMG, Gatekeeper accepted both, the mounted DMG app revalidated, and the private GitHub release assets matched their local SHA-256 digests.

**Left off at**: Version 1.0.0 is published privately at https://github.com/oliverames/skylight-bridge/releases/tag/v1.0.0. The release tag points to `a6c66ac`, and `main` includes the follow-up portable-checksum fix at `5618e8a`.

**Open questions**: None.
