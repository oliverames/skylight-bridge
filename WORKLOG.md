## 2026-07-14 - Skylight Bridge 1.1.0: two-way sync and grouped-settings redesign

**What changed**: Reminders mappings now link lists symmetrically: either side can be an existing list or created new, including creating a fresh Apple Reminders list from the app to adopt a list that already lives on the Skylight. The first sync into an existing list links items whose title and completion state match instead of duplicating them. Recipes gained an optional two-way mode with a per-selection conflict policy: new Skylight recipes become notes, remote edits rewrite unchanged notes, both-changed conflicts resolve by newest/Apple/Skylight, and recipes deleted on Skylight move their notes to Recently Deleted. The recipe parser now accepts title-only and description-only notes so Skylight-authored recipes round-trip, and pushed recipe descriptions use the same grammar the parser reads. Photos and Meals stay push-only. The whole interface moved from Liquid Glass cards to standard grouped-settings forms (flat cards, bordered buttons, capsule badges, Tip footers) modeled on TinyStart; Liquid Glass remains only in system chrome.

**Decisions made**: Meal plans stay one-way because rewriting freeform meal notes from parsed data would risk user text. Recipe-note retirement uses the Notes trash (recoverable for 30 days) rather than hard deletion. Adoption matching is title+completion, case- and whitespace-insensitive, deterministic by identifier order. Conflict ties keep Apple as the source of truth.

**Verification**: All 52 tests pass normally, under AddressSanitizer, and under ThreadSanitizer. `./script/build_and_run.sh --verify` produced a signed bundle that launched cleanly; the running app performed a live sync against the real account and applied zero changes (no regressions or duplicates against 1.0 sync state). Screenshots confirmed the grouped-settings layout on Overview and Reminders. A coordinator test caught and fixed a resurrection bug where a note trashed by a Skylight-side deletion would have been re-pushed as a new recipe in the same run.

**Left off at**: Version 1.1.0 (build 2) committed on `main`. Release packaging (`script/build_release.sh`, defaults now 1.1.0/2) still needs the notarization credentials (`NOTARY_KEY_FILE`, `NOTARY_KEY_ID`, `NOTARY_ISSUER_ID`) to produce the stapled DMG.

**Open questions**: None.

## 2026-07-13 - Skylight Bridge 1.0 release

**What changed**: Completed the native macOS 26 and 27 application with selective Apple Photos, Reminders, Recipes, and Meals configuration; Liquid Glass layouts; Keychain-backed authentication; signed local state; discovered Skylight API diagnostics; and Developer ID release packaging.

**Decisions made**: Apple remains the source of truth. Photos mirror only selected albums, Favorites, or hand-picked assets. Reminders sync only selected lists or items to Skylight lists. The app intentionally provides no calendar, task, chore, or rewards synchronization interface.

**Verification**: All 39 tests passed normally, under AddressSanitizer, under ThreadSanitizer, and with the authenticated live API lifecycle enabled. The Skylight portal showed exactly two items in Money and two photos from Our House; a repeated live sync applied zero changes. Apple accepted and stapled the signed app and DMG, Gatekeeper accepted both, the mounted DMG app revalidated, and the private GitHub release assets matched their local SHA-256 digests.

**Left off at**: Version 1.0.0 is published privately at https://github.com/oliverames/skylight-bridge/releases/tag/v1.0.0. The release tag points to `a6c66ac`, and `main` includes the follow-up portable-checksum fix at `5618e8a`.

**Open questions**: None.
